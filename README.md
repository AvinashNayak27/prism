# Prism - AI Art Platform

> *Metaphor for colors combining into art.*

Prism is an AI-driven art platform built on BaseColors, where creativity flows through the spectrum of owned colors. Each artwork is generated from palettes of existing color NFTs, transforming simple shades into vibrant, unique art pieces.

## üåà Features

- **AI-Driven Art Generation**: Create unique artworks from color palettes using advanced AI
- **Color NFT Ownership**: Own colors on BaseColors and earn royalties when they're used in art
- **Automatic Royalty Distribution**: Earn passive income when your colors are used in new artworks
- **Living Licensing Model**: Your color ownership becomes a participatory licensing model
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern, responsive design with glassmorphism effects and smooth animations
